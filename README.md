For everyone who somehow found my github page:

This is just some dumb discord theme I threw together.
I can't emphasise this enough:
I literally just copied the configuration from the Nord-Theme and NotAnotherAnimeTheme into one file.

The .css does NOT have pretty code and is probably a much bigger mess than any of those shitty html sites we wrote back in school.
I do NOT recommend you to use, or even downlod my theme as I still don't have any idea of css or coding in general.
Ok, with all these disclaimers out of the way, here is the important stuff:


Prerequisites:
+ Bandaged Discord by rauenzi - https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp
+ Glasscord by AryToNeX - https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord
+ At least a bit of CSS and HTML knowledge!

Reps and projects I used, to make this work:
- Nord-Glasscord by YottaGitHub: https://github.com/YottaGitHub/Nord-Glasscord

The theme uses 4 different libraries/imports:
1. NotAnotherAnimeTheme by puckzxz#2080 - https://github.com/puckzxz/NotAnotherAnimeTheme   (Double Column)
2. BlurpleRecolor by mwittrien - https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/BlurpleRecolor
3. AdjustableServerWidth by Gibbu - https://github.com/DiscordStyles/AdjustableServerWidth
      
      NOTE: This theme is not fully compatible with N.A.A.T. (1.), so I copied a part of the code and commented out Gibbu's css.
4. The "Ballo2" font by Ek Type - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+2?preview.text_type=custom

You may have noticed the dcsl.css in this rep. Because of a recent update, I had to patch NotAnotherAnimeTheme myself, until
the creater did, but as you can see in the file, my version is not used anymore.

Here are the edits I have done:

~ Optimizations for that transparent look.

~ General color improvements that still need some work. (especially when the background is bright)

~ "Explore Public Servers"-button is now hidden. (you can still click it)

~ Multiple fixes, to make the server column work with "Glasscord" and "AdjustableServerWidth".

NOTE:
While sorting all those imports I noticed, the old Nord-Theme used a libary that got taken down for stealing discord tokens. DONT TRUST ANYBODY!!!
